# TextWithFriends


In this project, I use an unsupervised technique for assessing the sentiment polarity of
every sentence uttered by one of the six main Friends characters over the 10 seasons
of the show. I then generate aggregate statistics from this polarity dataset, such as max
sentiment, average sentiment, and variance sentiment. Next, I rank the characters in
order of their generated statistic, and see how this correlates to several online polls
a bout the “likeability” of Friends characters. I repeat this analysis by aggregating to the
season level. The results reveal that statistics generated from sentiment polarity are a
good predictor for fan’s favorite characters (p < 0.06), but a poor predictor for the
likeability of a season.
